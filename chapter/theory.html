                <h2>Design Principles</h2>
                <p>The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation in team
                    sports through online communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not
                    possible to achieve this goal if the application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design
                    principles of several disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric solution.</p>
            </header>
            <h3>User Experience Design</h3>

            <p>The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple
                <span>(NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.)</span>. User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction
                with a company, its services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good user
                experience is to meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different
                disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design
                <span>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</span>.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="zitat">
                <p>Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our
                    needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad
                    design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.</p>
                <footer>NORMAN, 2013, P. XI</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the
                haptics, and the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary
                factors: its look, feel, and usability <span>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04)</span>.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Look</dt>
                <dd>The “look” satisfies the user’s visual expectations of the product. It is about creating a product
                    that is visually appealing and conveys the essence of the product to the user. In addition to pure
                    aesthetics, it is also important that the content is communicated simply and understandably.
                    Therefore, it is not only important how the product looks like but also how information is
                    presented.</dd>

                <dt>Feel</dt>
                <dd>The “feel” is about creating products that are not only functional but also fun to use. It is
                    important that it is a pleasant and intuitive experience when interacting with the product on a
                    daily basis.</dd>

                <dt>Usability</dt>
                <dd>Usability is the cornerstone of user experience because if a product is difficult to use, the
                    experience of using it will never be positive. Products should be designed to meet the needs of the
                    user, and the product’s functions should be predictable for the user.</dd>

            <p>User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and behavior of the user.
                Understanding how users perceive a product allows user experience designers to iterate their concepts
                and better achieve the user’s goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah Diefenbach’s paper
                *Well-being*, *Need Fulfillment*, and *Experience Design*, any positive experience is based on meeting
                psychological needs. The fulfillment of psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness,
                popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to the well-being of the user and leads to a pleasant
                user experience. In experience design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the design
                process <span>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</span>.</p>

            <p>Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the following, they are considered
                from the perspective of emotion, while additional needs are addressed.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Competence</dt>
                <dd>Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective instead of
                    thinking that one is incapable and incompetent <span>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</span>.
                </dd>

                <dt>Relatedness</dt>
                <dd>Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with the people in the
                    environment, rather than feeling lonely or unnoticed <span>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P.
                        1)</span>.</dd>

                <dt>Popularity</dt>
                <dd>Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than feeling like a
                    person whose advice and opinion are ignored <span>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</span>.</dd>

                <dt>Stimulation</dt>
                <dd>Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of feeling bored and
                    understimulated <span>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</span>.</dd>

                <dt>Security</dt>
                <dd>Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather than feeling
                    uncertain and threatened by circumstances one cannot control <span>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012,
                        P. 1)</span>.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating people to participate
                in various activities. Thus, it is also an important factor for participation in sports. Since this
                thesis addresses the question of how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the
                user’s participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid especially on
                relatedness.</p>

            <p>In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”. In addition to the approach
                of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other approaches define user needs for good user experience. Design leader
                Stephen P. Anderson, for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model <span>(→ FIG.
                    05)</span>. Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, this model is based on
                a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed through six stages of maturity,
                during which they can grow from a purely functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user
                <span>(ANDERSON, 2011, P. 10F.)</span>.

                <h2>Design Methods</h2>
                <p>After discussing the design principles necessary for a good user experience, this section elaborates
                    on specific ways to approach the design process.</p>

                <h3>Community-Centered Design</h3>

                <p>It is important to provide members within a community the opportunity to interact with each other
                    (PREECES, 2004, P. 3FF). According to Preece, developing online communities is different from
                    designing
                    software as software, once shipped, is stable and does not change until the next update while online
                    communities develop and change through dynamic interactions. It is first and foremost a social
                    experience that changes according to who is participating, the number of people involved, and the
                    type
                    of discussion that takes place (IBID., P.4). For example, the dynamics between new and
                    long-established
                    communities differ notably. While the software might not change drastically, social interactions
                    will
                    adapt according to the growth of the community. This social adaption is called “sociability”
                    (IBID.).
                </p>

                <p>In many online communities, these social changes are at least as influential as software changes.
                    Therefore, crucial to not only focus on the usability of the design but also on sociability.
                    Therefore,
                    knowledge from different disciplines such as sociology, social psychology, anthropology, as well as
                    user-centered design is required (IBID.). In participatory community-centered design methodology (→
                    FIG.
                    07), members of the community are involved in the design process from the beginning. In
                    community-centered design, six phases are each followed by an evaluation period and iterations based
                    on
                    the findings.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Assess the Needs of the Community</dt>
                    <dd>The first step involves understanding the community. This means understanding the community’s
                        needs.
                        It is important to understand who the members of the community are and what the main purpose of
                        the
                        community is. It is about understanding for whom this community exists and what the
                        participants’
                        habits are (PREECE, 2004, P. 4).</dd>

                    <dt>Select a Technology Plan for Sociability</dt>
                    <dd>After understanding the potential members of the community, it is important to select the
                        technology
                        for communication within the community. Suitable mediums, such as timelines, discussion boards,
                        or
                        chat areas, must be discussed and the software should be tailored to suit the needs of the
                        community
                        (PREECE, 2004, P. 4F.).</dd>

                    <dt>Test Prototype</dt>
                    <dd>Step three requires testing of the prototype with the potential members of the community. The
                        intended software and sociability structures need to be validated at a basic level. This
                        validation
                        includes the representation of social policies and social interactions. For example, if members
                        must
                        complete a registration policy before joining the community, its comprehensibility must be
                        ensured.
                        In this step, iterative changes are made according to the user feedback (PREECE, 2004, P. 5).
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Test Sociability and Usability</dt>
                    <dd>Step four extends the testing made in step three and focuses on validating the design choices
                        for
                        good user experience and sociability. The usability, user interface, and the feel of the
                        interaction
                        are tested with the user. At this stage, substantial emphasis is laid on the overall user
                        experience. (PREECE, 2004, P. 5).</dd>

                    <dt>Nurture the Community</dt>
                    <dd>After establishing the basis for the online community, the final step consists of nurturing the
                        community. It is the most important process as long as the community exists, since nurturing the
                        community allows new members to feel welcomed and supported, thus enabling growth. Furthermore,
                        the
                        community must be well advertised, so that this growth can continue over a long period of time
                        (PREECE, 2004, P. 5F.).</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>A community-centered design process is crucial to a community’s life cycle, as it ensures that
                    members of
                    respective communities are heard. This assurance allows the design to adapt and change based on
                    their
                    ideas, desires, and needs. Designing for online communities is iterative by nature and should
                    reflect
                    the community’s evolution (IBID., P. 6).</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>

                <p>A design process can be approached in numerous ways. The previously mentioned community-centered
                    design
                    process is tailored specifically towards online communities and how members interact with each
                    other.
                    The problem, however, is that factoring in the unanimous behavior of a large group may result in
                    neglect
                    of an individual’s personal experience with the product. A more personal and empathetic approach is
                    that
                    of human-centered design (HCD).</p>

                <p>HCD factors in the emotional and psychological preferences of the individual. According to Norman,
                    this
                    approach that “puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those
                    needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving” (NORMAN, 2013, P. 8). HCD puts the individual experience
                    with
                    the product first, considering the whole user experience (IXDF - UCD, N.D.). Norman describes HCD as
                    a
                    philosophy that starts with understanding humans and their needs and difficulties through
                    observation.
                    Since people often do not realize their own needs, it is the designers’ responsibility to observe
                    and
                    define them (NORMAN, 2013, P. 9).</p>

                <p>There are four different phases in HCD (→ FIG. 08).</p>



                <dl>
                    <dt>Observation</dt>
                    <dd>Observation is the phase in which the user’s situation and the underlying problem that needs to
                        be
                        solved are researched by the designers. To understand the people for whom the solution is
                        intended,
                        one must observe them in their daily lives to fully understand their environment, the daily
                        problems
                        they encounter, and their goals. Furthermore, the current market offer is explored to determine
                        how
                        the problem has been approached by others (NORMAN, 2013, P. 222F.).</dd>

                    <dt>Ideation</dt>
                    <dd>Through ideation, potential solutions for the given problem are explored. Based on the insights
                        gained in the research phase, various ideas are accumulated to select the best solution for the
                        given problem. It is important that no idea is discarded or focused on too early, as creative
                        variety is the essence of ideation (NORMAN, 2013, P. 226).</dd>

                    <dt>Prototyping</dt>
                    <dd>After the ideas are prototyped, they become tangible so that they can be tested later. Since
                        feedback is crucial in the early stages of the design process, prototypes contain only the core
                        functionality of the product with the relevant components that need validation. Prototypes
                        demonstrate the real product (NORMAN, 2013, P. 227F.).</dd>

                    <dt>Testing</dt>
                    <dd>Testing the prototypes with real users who correspond closely to the target demographic uncovers
                        weaknesses and strengths of the concept. Assumptions made up to this point can be confirmed or
                        refuted. Furthermore, the insights gathered throughout this phase are used to shape the
                        subsequent
                        iterations, thus improving the solution in the process (NORMAN, 2013, P. 228F.).</dd>

                <p>These four phases are repeated constantly until the solution fulfills potential. HCD is an iterative
                    process in which each iteration produces more insight, bringing the solution closer to its goal. The
                    result is a product that resonates more deeply with the target audience (NORMAN, 2013 P. 229F.). HCD
                    might also be called user-centered design (W3C - UCD, N.D.).</p>

                <h3>Design Thinking</h3>

                <p>Design thinking is a process that, similarly to HCD, is centered on the user. The difference,
                    however,
                    lies in its end goal. HCD is a creative approach that solves known problems by gaining a deep
                    understanding of and empathy for the target demographic (IDEO, N.D.). According to Michael
                    Burmester,
                    the ultimate goal of HCD is to ensure high usability and good user experience with digital
                    interfaces
                    (BURMESTER, 2016). Design thinking, on the other hand, is a more general approach to innovation that
                    is
                    not restricted to digital products. It, thus, has a far wider range of application. According to
                    IDEO,
                    the end goal of design thinking is the creation of innovative products that allow “people [to] find
                    the
                    sweet spot of feasibility, viability and desirability while considering the real needs and desires
                    of
                    people” (IDEO, N.D.).</p>

                <p>Similar to HCD, design thinking is not to be seen as a process or system that must be followed in a
                    certain way but rather as a philosophy or mindset for how to approach human issues (AJ&SMART, 2018).
                    According to the Hasso-Plattner-Institute of Design at Stanford (d.school), design thinking can be
                    divided into five phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test (D.SCHOOL, N.D.) (→ FIG.
                    08).</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Empathize</dt>
                    <dd>For the design thinking process, it is first important to gain an empathic understanding of the
                        user
                        and the problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, it is crucial to research the users to
                        really
                        understand their needs, their objectives, their thoughts, their emotions, and their struggles.
                        This
                        can be achieved by observing the user, engaging with the user, or a combination of both
                        (D.SCHOOL,
                        N.D.).</dd>
                    <dt>Define</dt>
                    <dd>The second stage is dedicated to defining the problem. This is accomplished by compiling
                        information
                        gained throughout the empathizing phase. This widespread information is then analyzed and
                        synthesized to define the core problems of the user. Defining the problem through a problem
                        statement will help during the design process to address the relevant problems at any given time
                        without losing focus or straying from the main objective. Defining the problem is about bringing
                        clarity and focus to the design process (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).</dd>
                    <dt>Ideate</dt>
                    <dd>After gaining a solid understanding of the users and their problems, potential ideas for the
                        identified problems are explored. Ideation is about pushing for the widest possible range of
                        ideas
                        to select the best solution for the given problem (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).</dd>
                    <dt>Prototype</dt>
                    <dd>Prototyping involves experimentation and turning ideas into tangible products. A prototype is a
                        scaled-down version of a product that incorporates the potential solutions identified in the
                        previous stages. Prototypes are created to communicate ideas to users (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).</dd>
                    <dt>Test</dt>
                    <dd>Testing the prototypes allows the designers to gain valuable feedback from real users. It is
                        also
                        another opportunity to understand the user, but unlike the initial empathize phase, the insights
                        gained from the preceding phases facilitate a deeper and more realistic understanding of the
                        user.
                        This newfound empathy and knowledge can be used in subsequent iterations to refine a product to
                        its
                        maximum potential (D.SCHOOL, N.D.).</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>For the concept of this thesis, design thinking will be applied to find a creative solution on how to
                    support the user’s participation in team sports. Based on that solution, HCD will guide the design
                    process to ensure high-quality user experience and usability. Furthermore, the principles of
                    community-centered design will be used to emphasize sociability throughout the concept.</p>
